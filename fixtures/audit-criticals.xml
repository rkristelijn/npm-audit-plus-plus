    <testcase name="Prototype Pollution in node-forge debug API.
### Impact
The `forge.debug` API had a potential prototype pollution issue if called with untrusted input. The API was only used for internal debug purposes in a safe way and never documented or advertised.  It is suspected that uses of this API, if any exist, would likely not have used untrusted inputs in a vulnerable way.

### Patches
The `forge.debug` API and related functions were removed in 1.0.0.

### Workarounds
Don't use the `forge.debug` API directly or indirectly with untrusted input.

    <testcase name="URL parsing in node-forge could lead to undesired behavior.
### Impact
The regex used for the `forge.util.parseUrl` API would not properly parse certain inputs resulting in a parsed data structure that could lead to undesired behavior.

### Patches
`forge.util.parseUrl` and other very old related URL APIs were removed in 1.0.0 in favor of letting applications use the more modern WHATWG URL Standard API.

### Workarounds
Ensure code does not directly or indirectly call `forge.util.parseUrl` with untrusted input.

    <testcase name="Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in `node-forge`
### Impact

RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is not properly checking `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest.

### Patches

The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` `1.3.0`.

    <testcase name="yargs-parser Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
Affected versions of `yargs-parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--foo.__proto__.bar baz'` adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs-parser`.



## Recommendation

Upgrade to versions 13.1.2, 15.0.1, 18.1.1 or later.

    <testcase name="jsonwebtoken unrestricted key type could lead to legacy keys usage 
# Overview

Versions `&lt;=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library could be misconfigured so that legacy, insecure key types are used for signature verification. For example, DSA keys could be used with the RS256 algorithm. 

# Am I affected?

You are affected if you are using an algorithm and a key type other than the combinations mentioned below

| Key type |  algorithm                                    |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| ec           | ES256, ES384, ES512                      |
| rsa          | RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, PS512 |
| rsa-pss  | PS256, PS384, PS512                      |

And for Elliptic Curve algorithms:

| `alg` | Curve      |
|-------|------------|
| ES256 | prime256v1 |
| ES384 | secp384r1  |
| ES512 | secp521r1  |

# How do I fix it?

Update to version 9.0.0. This version validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, If you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you’ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions.

# Will the fix impact my users?

There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you already use a valid secure combination of key type and algorithm. Otherwise,  use the  `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and `verify()` functions to continue usage of invalid key type/algorithm combination in 9.0.0 for legacy compatibility.

    <testcase name="jsonwebtoken's insecure implementation of key retrieval function could lead to Forgeable Public/Private Tokens from RSA to HMAC
# Overview

Versions `&lt;=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function (referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the [readme link](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback)) will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification  than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of forged tokens. 

# Am I affected?

You will be affected if your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function. 

# How do I fix it?
 
Update to version 9.0.0.

# Will the fix impact my users?

There is no impact for end users

    <testcase name="Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in node-forge
### Impact

RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used.

### Patches

The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` `1.3.0`.

    <testcase name="jsonwebtoken vulnerable to signature validation bypass due to insecure default algorithm in jwt.verify()
# Overview

In versions &lt;=8.5.1 of jsonwebtoken library, lack of algorithm definition and a falsy secret or key in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification.

# Am I affected?
You will be affected if all the following are true in the `jwt.verify()` function:
- a token with no signature is received
- no algorithms are specified 
- a falsy (e.g. null, false, undefined) secret or key is passed 

# How do I fix it?
 
Update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. 

# Will the fix impact my users?

There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don’t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options.

    <testcase name="Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method
The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object.

This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.

## Impact
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.

## Mitigation
This vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.

## Details
 
Suppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:
 
```js
const JSON5 = require('json5');

const doSomethingDangerous = (props) =&gt; {
  if (props.isAdmin) {
    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');
  } else {
    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');
  }
};

const secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) =&gt; {
  let searchKeyFound = false;
  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) =&gt; {
    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) &gt; -1) {
      searchKeyFound = true;
    }
  });
  return searchKeyFound;
};

const props = JSON5.parse('{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}');
if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {
  doSomethingDangerous(props); // &quot;Doing dangerous thing as user.&quot;
} else {
  throw new Error('Forbidden...');
}
```
 
If the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:
 
```js
const props = JSON5.parse('{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;isAdmin&quot;: true}');
if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {
  doSomethingDangerous(props);
} else {
  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...
}
```
 
However, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{&quot;isAdmin&quot;: true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:
 
```js
const props = JSON5.parse('{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;__proto__&quot;: {&quot;isAdmin&quot;: true}}');
if (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {
  doSomethingDangerous(props); // &quot;Doing dangerous thing as admin.&quot;
} else {
  throw new Error('Forbidden...');
}
 ```

ansi-regex is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity which could lead to a denial of service when parsing invalid ANSI escape codes.

**Proof of Concept**
```js
import ansiRegex from 'ansi-regex';
for(var i = 1; i &lt;= 50000; i++) {
    var time = Date.now();
    var attack_str = &quot;\u001B[&quot;+&quot;;&quot;.repeat(i*10000);
    ansiRegex().test(attack_str)
    var time_cost = Date.now() - time;
    console.log(&quot;attack_str.length: &quot; + attack_str.length + &quot;: &quot; + time_cost+&quot; ms&quot;)
}
```
The ReDOS is mainly due to the sub-patterns `[[\\]()#;?]*` and `(?:;[-a-zA-Z\\d\\/#&amp;.:=?%@~_]*)*`
